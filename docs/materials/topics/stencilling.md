# Stencilling

## Overview
Stencilling allows you to control the drawing of pixels based on custom rules which allows for effects like masking, outlining, and multi-pass rendering. You can control both reading and writing to the stencil buffer to create these effects.

When using stencils on a single entity, you'll need to use [Multi-Pass Rendering](/materials/techniques/multi-pass%20rendering.md). This allows you to write to the buffer in one controller then read from it in another.

To apply stencil operations, you must first enable the required state `StencilWrite` and/or `EnableStencilTest`.

## Understanding Stencil Operations
### Per-Face Stencilling Operations
Per-face stencilling is controlled by the `frontFace` and `backFace` properties. Each face can independently read or write to the stencil buffer. The first key property is `stencilFunc`, which defines when the stencil test passes.

| **Parameter** | **Description**                             | **Options/Values**      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| stencilFunc   | Determines the stencil comparison function. | Always, Equal, NotEqual |

| **Stencil Func** | **Description**                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always         | The stencil test always passes.                                                         |
| Equal          | Passes if (stencilRef & stencilReadMask) == (stencil buffer value & stencilReadMask). |
| Not Equal      | Passes if (stencilRef & stencilReadMask) != (stencil buffer value & stencilReadMask). |

### Stencil Test Results
There are three key properties that define what happens when the stencil and depth tests pass or fail.

| **Parameter**        | **Description**                                                     | **Options         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| stencilFailOp      | Action to take if the stencil test fails.                           | Keep, Replace |
| stencilDepthFailOp | Action to take if the stencil test passes but the depth test fails. | Keep, Replace |
| stencilPassOp      | Action to take if both the stencil and depth tests pass.            | Keep, Replace |
### Material-Scoped Stencilling Properties
In the material, there are also properties that apply to the material as a whole which are shown below.

| **Parameter**        | **Description**                                                                | **Options**                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| stencilRef         | Reference value for stencil testing.                                           | Number (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.) |
| stencilReadMask    | Bitmask applied to the stencil buffer and stencilRef during stencil testing. | Number (e.g., 255, 1)          |
| stencilWriteMask   | Bitmask used to control which bits in the stencil buffer are written.          | Number (e.g., 1, 255)          |
| stencilRefOverride | Optional override for stencilRef, not always used.                           | Number (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.) |

## Reading and Writing to the Stencil Buffer

> With vibrant visuals, stencils are broken before 1.21.120 and require you to use a stencil mask past that point. The buffer is shared with PBR so there can be some strange interactions, e.g., 255 stencil mask will add the underwater water effect to the tops of geometry.

### Writing To The Stencil Buffer
When you write to the stencil buffer, you typically perform the following steps:
1. **Enable Stencil Testing and Writing**: Use `+states` to enable stencil testing (`EnableStencilTest`) and allow writing to the stencil buffer (`StencilWrite`).
2. **Set Stencil Operations**: Define how stencil operations affect the stencil buffer using `stencilFailOp`, `stencilDepthFailOp`, and `stencilPassOp`.
3. **Set Stencil Function**: Use `stencilFunc` to determine when the stencil test passes or fails. For writing, Always is commonly used to ensure that the stencil buffer is updated.
4. **Provide Reference Value**: Specify `stencilRef` to set the value that will be written to the stencil buffer.

The following example demonstrates how to write to the stencil buffer:
```json
"+states": [
    "StencilWrite",
    "EnableStencilTest"
],
"frontFace": {
    "stencilFunc": "Always",
    "stencilPassOp": "Replace"
},
"backFace": {
    "stencilFunc": "Always",
    "stencilPassOp": "Replace"
},
"stencilRef": 1,
"stencilWriteMask": 8
```

In this example, the material writes a reference value (`stencilRef`) to the stencil buffer, replacing the existing value regardless of whether the stencil test passes or fails. 

### Reading From the Stencil Buffer
When you read from the stencil buffer, you perform these steps:
1. **Enable Stencil Testing**: Use +states to enable stencil testing (`EnableStencilTest`).
2. **Set Stencil Function**: Use `stencilFunc` to determine the condition under which a fragment passes the stencil test based on the comparison between `stencilRef` and the stencil buffer value.
3. **Set Reference Value and Mask**: Provide `stencilRef` and optionally `stencilReadMask` to control the stencil test.
4. **Define Depth Function**: Adjust `depthFunc` if necessary (e.g., Always) to control depth testing during this pass.

The following material example shows how to read from the stencil buffer.

```json
"+states": [
    "EnableStencilTest"
],
"depthFunc": "Always",
"frontFace": {
    "stencilFunc": "Equal"
},
"backFace": {
    "stencilFunc": "Equal"
},
"stencilRef": 1,
"stencilReadMask": 8
```

In this example, the material reads from the stencil buffer to determine where to draw. It uses the stencil function to compare the `stencilRef` with the existing stencil buffer value.
